My project, __OECD Better Life Index__ was created to represent the different variables that define Life Satisfaction, and what quality of life is defined of. The OECD consists of mostly more advanced nations, and my project has also compared the Better Life Index differences within the OECD.

This project was created as a part of [***Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp***](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). ChatGPT has been utilized within this project.

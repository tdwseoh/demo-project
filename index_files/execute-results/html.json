The data was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the OECD and IMF (2024). Then, mapping data was used to visualize the correlations between the GDP per capita and other variables of BLI, thus the BLI visualized around the world. The visualization indicates that Northern European and Oceania countries represented the highest BLI, and the GDP per capita has been positively correlated with variables of the BLI.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n38 codes from your data successfully matched countries in the map\n0 codes from your data failed to match with a country code in the map\n205 codes from the map weren't represented in your data\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
